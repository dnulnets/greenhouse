# Homey Pro and Greenhouse Climate Control
Zigbee climate control for the greenhouse using the Sparkfun Thing Plus ESP32-C6 experimental board, Espressif toolchain and the Homey Pro as the HA-controller.


This is work in progress and is a prototype. The final solution will most likely be a set of devices.


[System architecture description](doc/README.md)

## The Goal of the project
To be able control the greenhouse climate including temperature, humidity and soil moisture by controlling the watering of the plants and the roof vents while measuring temperature inside and outside of the greenhouse, soil moisture and temperature, humidity and barometric pressure.

## What is happening now
I am currently setting up the entire toolchain and basic source structure for Homey and the Sparkfun device before moving towards creating the zigbee model for the ESP32 device.

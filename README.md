# Homey Pro and Greenhouse Climate Control
Zigbee climate control for the greenhouse using the Sparkfun Thing Plus ESP32-C6 experimental board, Espressif toolchain and the Homey Pro as the HA-controller.


This is work in progress and I am currently setting up the entire toolchain and basoc source structure for Homey and the Sparkfun device.

### The Goal of the project
To be able control the greenhouse climate including temperature, humidity and soil moisture by controlling the watering of the plants and the roof vents while measuring temperature inside and outside of the greenhouse, soil moisture and temperature, humidity and barometric pressure.
